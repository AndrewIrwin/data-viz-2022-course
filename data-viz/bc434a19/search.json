    "text": "This is the syllabus for the Data Visualization (STAT 2430) course offered in Fall 2022 at Dalhousie University.\n\nInstructor: Andrew Irwin, a.irwin@dal.ca\nMeeting times: Tuesday and Thursday 1:00-2:20 pm Atlantic in LSC-C338 and on Collaborate\nOffice hours: Wednesday 1:00 pm Atlantic on Collaborate, or by appointment.\n\n\n\nData visualization is the art and science of turning data into readable graphics. We will explore how to design and create data visualizations. This exploration will include both the principles and techniques of data visualization. Students will learn the value of visualization, specific techniques, and how to design and improve a data visualization.\n\n\nAt least one MATH or STAT course at or above the 1000 level. No experience with R or computer programming is required, but a desire to learn about both is essential.\n\n\n\n\nCourse notes:\n\nAndrew J Irwin (2022) Data visualization.\n\nTextbooks:\n\nKieran Healy (2018) Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction. Princeton University Press.\nClaus O. Wilke (2019) Fundamentals of data visualization. O’Reilly.\nGarret Grolemund & Hadley Wickham (2017) R for data science. O’Reilly.\n\nThe textbooks are available in printed form from bookstores and online. The online versions are free to use. You are not required to buy the books on paper. All three are excellent books with very distinct goals. The books by Healy and Wilke focus on the design and interpretation of data visualizations. The book by Grolemund and Wickham describes the use of R, particularly the set of packages known as the “tidyverse” for data visualization and the broader tasks of data science.\n\n\nWe will use the statistical software R and RStudio and version control software git. No prior experience with R, RStudio or git is assumed. We will take class time to learn the software.\n\nTo download and install R go to r-project.org and click on the link to download R\nTo download and install Rstudio, go to Rstudio.com and click on the link to download Rstudio\nTo download and install git:\n\non Windows, go to git-scm.org and click on the link to download a version for Windows\non Macintosh, use the Terminal app and type xcode-select --install to download and install git.\n\n\nThese tools can be installed on Linux computers as well. Contact me if you have trouble. If you have a Chromebook you can use all these tools through the cloud service rstudio.cloud. Everyone should learn to use the cloud service as a backup in case of problems with setting up the software on their own computer.\nR and Rstudio are available on Dalhousie computer labs, but the git version control software must be installed following the instructions for Windows computers above. Since all your user files are erased from lab computers when you log out, this process must be repeated on each login. For this reason, I don’t recommend using Dalhousie computer labs for this course, unless you are using rstudio.cloud.\nYou should install this software on your computer during the first week of the course. If you are unable to install the software, get in touch with me for assistance.\n\n\n\n\nEach week will be structured around the following components:\n\nReading course notes and suggested material from the textbooks.\nIn class meetings which will be a mixture of lectures, demonstrations, and skills practice. Some class time will be be dedicated to computer demonstrations and exercises; these times will be identified by a file describing the demonstration (marked Demo in the detailed outline). You are encouraged to bring your computer to these classes.\nOpportunities to develop and demonstrate your knowledge in course work to be evaluated (tasks, assignments, and a term project).\nScheduled office hours. Come to office hours if you have questions about the classes, readings, or work to be submitted for grading. If you can’t participate in office hours, but you have a question, please get in touch with me and arrange another time to meet.\n\nI recorded mini-lectures for most lessons the last time this course was offered. You don’t need to watch these, but if you wish additional material you can find them here.\nFollow the detailed outline for each week’s plan to keep you on track.\n\n\n\nYour goal in this course is to learn the principles and skills of data visualization. Most people learn best using a combination of collaborative and independent work. The general guideline is that work you submit should be your own—your ideas, your thoughts, your choices, your code, your typing. You are encouraged to discuss your work with the instructor and students. When you help another student, be careful you don’t help them so much that you inhibit their learning.\nTasks are opportunities to test your understanding of the key concepts from the lessons and demonstrate you have developed basic proficiency with essential computing skills. Most lessons will have a task for you to complete. You are expected to submit approximately one task to be graded each week. Tasks are primarily designed to help you learn and you are encouraged to seek assistance from classmates, but work you submit must be your own.\nAssignments combine skills from multiple lessons into a meaningful data visualization activity. These are opportunities to apply the content of lessons in thoughtful and sometimes creative ways. Assignments are assessments of your skills and should be done independently.\nThe Term Project is an opportunity to combine many of the skills learned in the course. You will explore, analyze, and present an analysis of a data set of your choice. Your proposal will select a data set and describe some of your planned analyses. The oral presentation will be a 5 minute overview of your data and key visualizations. The report will be a polished reproducible document demonstrating many of the ideas of the course using your selected data set. The term project is designed to be done collaboratively in a group. The work on the project should be the work of members of the group and not outside collaborators or internet sources.\n\nTasks (30%, approximately 1 per week, due weekly, equally weighted)\nAssignments (40%, roughly 1 every two weeks, equally weighted)\nTerm project, divided into three components\n\nProposal, due Thursday 27 October, 5%\nOral presentation, due Monday 5 December, 10%\nReport, due Wednesday 7 December, 15%\n\n\nTasks are due on Friday. Assignments are due on Wednesday. (Office hours are also on Wednesday for last-minute question.)\nCopying work from any other sources is not allowed and will be considered an academic offense for this course. You are encouraged to learn from many different sources. If you make use of material outside of course materials on assignments or the project report, include references to the material and a description of what you used in a “Sources used” section at the end of your work.\nLate policy. Tasks will not be accepted late, but you can submit two “catch-up” tasks to replace any tasks you may have missed, or if you want to improve your grade on a submitted task. Assignments will be accepted without penalty until the work is graded or solutions are posted. After that, no late assignments will be accepted. If an additional accommodation is requested and granted due to illness or other unforeseeable circumstance, the value of that work will be redistributed to other tasks or assignments. If you anticipate not being able to submit any component of the term project (proposal, oral presentation, or report) on time, please contact me by email.\nGrades will be reported on Brightspace\n\n\nYour numerical grade will be converted to a letter grade for the course using the Dalhousie Common Grade Scale.\nFirst your numerical grade will be rounded up to the nearest integer, then it will be converted to a letter using this table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n    \n      A+\n      A\n      A-\n      B+\n      B\n      B-\n      C+\n      C\n      C-\n      D\n      F\n    \n  \n  \n    90-100\n85-89\n80-84\n77-79\n73-76\n70-72\n65-69\n60-64\n55-59\n50-54\n0-49\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease do not come on campus if you have symptoms similar to COVID-19 such as a fever or cough, if you have had a close contact with someone who has COVID-19, or if you have COVID-19.\nThe course is intended to be delivered in person, on campus at Dalhousie. I hope that most of you will be physically present in the classroom for most classes. Since you can be infected and transmit the virus without experiencing any symptoms, I encourage everyone to wear a high-quality mask while on campus to reduce the probability of virus transmission. Dalhousie policy requires you to wear a mask when you are in our classroom. I anticipate that some students will need to miss some classes following a close contact with an infected person, developing symptoms similar to COVID-19, or contracting COVID-19. I plan to make all course meetings available live and recorded on Brightspace using Collaborate Ultra. This means that you can participate in the whole course even if you can’t attend a particular class. I expect the online experience will not be as good as the in-person class. You are not required to be physically present on campus for classes, tests, or a final exam. Oral presentations for the term project will be synchronous but online – you need to be available during class time on these days, but not physically present in the classroom. This design is to keep you safe and to help you keep your classmates safe.\nIf I am unable to be on campus, the class will be delivered remotely.\nCovid data:\n\nNova Scotia provincial government dashboard and monthly epidemiologic summaries.\nWastewater virus monitoring collected by the federal government.\n\n\n\n\nDuring the course you will create work on a third-party website (github.com). These files will be shared only with the instructor, TAs, and student team members. All files will be kept for 6 months after the end of the course. Repositories will be deleted after that time. If you wish to keep files after that date, either clone the repositories to your computer or fork them to your own GitHub account separate from the course.\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday 6 September: Term begins\nMonday 10 October: Thanksgiving day, University closed\nNovember 7-11: Study break\nFri 11 November: Remembrance Day\nTue 6 December: Last Tuesday/Thursday class\n\nIf you know you will be unable to meet certain deadlines in advance, for bona fide reasons such as scheduled medical appointments or religious observances, please contact me as soon as practical.\nI will never require you to provide a medical note or to use the Student Declaration of Absence form.\nFor due dates for evaluations, see the detailed course outline and evaluation schedule.\n\n\n\nThe Dalhousie University Senate acknowledges that we are in Mi’kma’ki, the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi’kmaq People and pays respect to the Indigenous knowledges held by the Mi’kmaq People, and to the wisdom of their Elders past and present. The Mi’kmaq People signed Peace and Friendship Treaties with the Crown, and section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 recognizes and affirms Aboriginal and Treaty rights.\nThe Dalhousie University Senate also acknowledges the histories, contributions, and legacies of African Nova Scotians, who have been here for over 400 years. For more information see, e.g., the Black Cultural Centre for Nova Scotia\n\n\n\nThis course is governed by the academic rules and regulations set forth in the University Calendar and by Senate.\nMissed or Late Academic Requirements due to Student Absence. Information on the university policy, including the use of the Student Declaration of Absence can be found here.\nAcademic Integrity. At Dalhousie University, we are guided in all of our work by the values of academic integrity: honesty, trust, fairness, responsibility and respect (The Center for Academic Integrity, Duke University, 1999). As a student, you are required to demonstrate these values in all of the work you do. The University provides policies and procedures that every member of the university community is required to follow to ensure academic integrity. More information.\nAccessibility. The Advising and Access Services Centre is Dalhousie’s centre of expertise for student accessibility and accommodation. The advising team works with students who request accommodation as a result of a disability, religious obligation, or any barrier related to any other characteristic protected under Human Rights legislation (Canada and Nova Scotia). More information.\nStudent Code of Conduct. Everyone at Dalhousie is expected to treat others with dignity and respect. The Code of Student Conduct allows Dalhousie to take disciplinary action if students don’t follow this community expectation. When appropriate, violations of the code can be resolved in a reasonable and informal manner—perhaps through a restorative justice process. If an informal resolution can’t be reached, or would be inappropriate, procedures exist for formal dispute resolution. Code.\nDiversity and Inclusion - Culture of Respect. Every person at Dalhousie has a right to be respected and safe. We believe inclusiveness is fundamental to education. We stand for equality. Dalhousie is strengthened in our diversity. We are a respectful and inclusive community. We are committed to being a place where everyone feels welcome and supported, which is why our Strategic Direction prioritizes fostering a culture of diversity and inclusiveness. Statement.\nElders in Residence. The Elders in Residence program provides students with access to First Nations elders for guidance, counsel and support. Visit or e-mail the Indigenous Student Centre (1321 Edward St) (elders@dal.ca). Information.\nOriginality Checking Software. I do not use any third-party software to systematically evaluate student work for originality. I may use Google or other searches to check the originality of any work submitted for credit, in accordance with the Student Submission of Assignments and Use of Originality Checking Software Policy. Students are free, without penalty of grade, to choose an alternative method of attesting to the authenticity of their work, and must inform the instructor no later than the last day to add/drop classes of their intent to choose an alternate method. Read the policy here.\n\nImportant Dates in the Academic Year (including add/drop dates)\nUniversity Grading Practices\n\n\n\n\nPlease follow the following links for additional resources and support.\nAdvising: General Advising, Science Program Advisors, Indigenous Student Centre, Black Advising Centre, International Centre\nAcademic supports: Library, Writing Centre, Studying for Success, Copyright Office, Fair Dealing Guidelines\nOther supports and services: Student Health & Wellness Centre, Student Advocacy, Ombudsperson\nSafety: Biosafety, Chemical Safety, Radiation Safety, Scent‐Free Program"

    "text": "Class meetings will be in person in LSC C338 on Tuesday and Thursday 1:00-2:20. If you are unable to attend class in person, you can participate live online or watch the recording later. Managing a hybrid course is challenging and I expect the in-person experience will be better than the online version. Links to these sessions will be on Brightspace.\nEach lesson below has links to course notes and slides. Course notes contain further links to textbook readings and other material to help you learn. Some students will prefer to begin by attending class, others will prefer to begin with the written notes and slides. I suggest you learn which you prefer by experimentation. The tasks are designed to help you be sure you know the most important parts of each lesson.\n\n\nThis is a plan for the term. Timing of course content may change. Slides will normally appear before the class, but you can expect last-minute changes and maybe some edits after class is over.\nTasks are due Friday at 6:00 pm Atlantic each week. Due dates for assignment and term project component are listed below.\nRecordings from the previous offering of this course are available, but this course will deviate somewhat from that version of the course.\nSlides and other materials presented in class will be posted here when they are ready.\n\n\n\n \n  \n    Date \n    Lesson \n    Title \n    Slides \n    Evaluation \n    Demo \n  \n \n\n  Week 1\n\n    Tue  6 Sep \n    0 \n    Course mechanics \n    Slides \n     \n     \n  \n  \n    Tue  6 Sep \n    1 \n    Invitation \n    Slides \n    Invitation \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu  8 Sep \n    2 \n    Computer tools \n    Slides \n    Bonus task \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu  8 Sep \n    3 \n    Accessing computer tools \n    Live demo \n    Setting up \n    Demo (Rmd) \n  \n  Week 2\n\n    Tue 13 Sep \n    4 \n    Look at data \n    Slides \n    Look \n     \n  \n  \n    Tue 13 Sep \n    5 \n    Making your first plot \n    Slides \n    Bonus task \n    Demo (Rmd) \n  \n  \n    Thu 15 Sep \n    6 \n    Version control \n    Slides \n     \n    Demo (Rmd) \n  \n  Week 3\n\n    Tue 20 Sep \n    7 \n    Introduction to the grammar of graphics \n    Slides \n    Bonus task \n     \n  \n  \n    Tue 20 Sep \n    8 \n    Using the grammar of graphics \n    Slides \n    Bonus task \n     \n  \n  \n    Wed 21 Sep \n     \n    Assignment 1 due \n     \n    Assignment 1 \n     \n  \n  Week 4\n\n    Tue 27 Sep \n    9 \n    Summarizing data \n    Slides \n    Summarize \n     \n  \n  \n    Tue 27 Sep \n    10 \n    Plotting facets \n    Slides \n    Facets \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu 29 Sep \n    11 \n    Reading data \n     \n    Bonus task \n     \n  \n  \n    Fri 30 Sep \n     \n    National Day for Truth and Reconciliation, no course work due on holidays \n     \n     \n     \n  \n  Week 5\n\n    Tue  4 Oct \n    12 \n    Reshaping data \n     \n    Reshape \n     \n  \n  \n    Tue  4 Oct \n    13 \n    Displaying tables \n     \n    Tables \n     \n  \n  \n    Wed  5 Oct \n     \n    Assignment 2 due \n     \n    Assignment 2 \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu  6 Oct \n    14 \n    Getting help \n     \n    Bonus task \n     \n  \n  Week 6\n\n    Mon 10 Oct \n     \n    Thanksgiving day \n     \n     \n     \n  \n  \n    Tue 11 Oct \n    15 \n    Working with models \n     \n    Bonus task \n     \n  \n  \n    Tue 11 Oct \n    16 \n    Linear models \n     \n    Linear models \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu 13 Oct \n    17 \n    LOESS and GAM \n     \n    LOESS-GAM \n     \n  \n  Week 7\n\n    Sun 16 Oct \n     \n    Project teams sign-up deadline \n     \n    Team Planning \n     \n  \n  \n    Tue 18 Oct \n    18 \n    Collaboration with GitHub \n     \n    Collaboration \n     \n  \n  \n    Wed 19 Oct \n     \n    Assignment 3 due \n     \n    Assignment 3 \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu 20 Oct \n    19 \n    Finding data \n     \n    Bonus task \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu 20 Oct \n    20 \n    Reproducible reports \n     \n    Reports \n     \n  \n  Week 8\n\n    Tue 25 Oct \n    21 \n    PCA \n     \n    PCA \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu 27 Oct \n    22 \n    MDS \n     \n     \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu 27 Oct \n    23 \n    K-means \n     \n    K-means \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu 27 Oct \n     \n    Project proposal due \n     \n    Proposal \n     \n  \n  Week 9\n\n    Tue  1 Nov \n    24 \n    Slide presentations \n     \n    Presentation \n     \n  \n  \n    Tue  1 Nov \n    25 \n    Checking your work \n     \n     \n     \n  \n  \n    Wed  2 Nov \n     \n    Assignment 4 due \n     \n    Assignment 4 \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu  3 Nov \n    26 \n    Dynamic graphics \n     \n     \n     \n  \n  Week 10\n\n    Fri 11 Nov \n     \n    Remembrance day \n     \n     \n     \n  \n  Week 11\n\n    Tue 15 Nov \n    27 \n    Making maps \n     \n    Bonus task \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu 17 Nov \n    28 \n    More about maps \n     \n    Maps \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu 17 Nov \n    29 \n    Alternatives to maps \n     \n    Map alternatives \n     \n  \n  Week 12\n\n    Tue 22 Nov \n    30 \n    Factors and Dates \n     \n    Factors and Dates \n     \n  \n  \n    Wed 23 Nov \n     \n    Assignment 5 due \n     \n    Assignment 5 \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu 24 Nov \n    31 \n    Using colour \n     \n    Bonus task \n     \n  \n  \n    Thu 24 Nov \n    32 \n    Themes \n     \n    Themes \n     \n  \n  Week 13\n\n    Tue 29 Nov \n    33 \n    Graphics output \n     \n     \n     \n  \n  \n    Tue 29 Nov \n    34 \n    Reconstructing a visualization \n     \n     \n     \n  \n  Week 14\n\n    Mon  5 Dec \n     \n    Oral presentations, day 1 (online) \n     \n    Presentations \n     \n  \n  \n    Tue  6 Dec \n     \n    Oral presentations, day 2 (online) \n     \n     \n     \n  \n  \n    Tue  6 Dec \n     \n    Assignment 6 due \n     \n    Assignment 6 \n     \n  \n  \n    Wed  7 Dec \n     \n    Project report due \n     \n    Report"

    "text": "All the work you will complete for evaluation and credit in the course is described below.\n\n\nTasks for each lesson are described here. Each task is designed to demonstrate a particular skill or idea from the lesson or prepare for the next lesson.\nTasks will usually be evaluated on a 0-10 scale on the following rubric:\n\n0-5: Work missing or mostly incomplete.\n6-7: Mostly complete or complete with major deficiencies.\n8: Complete and meets expectations.\n9-10: Complete and excels in some respect: engagement with the task, creativity in the thoughtful application of course skills and ideas, and organization of your work.\n\nTasks are grouped by week below. I encourage you to work on all the tasks. You are only required to submit one task for grading each week (except for week 1 which has two tasks and week 3 which has no tasks). If you miss a week or want to improve your grade from an evaluated task, I will accept two tasks in up to two weeks of your choosing, starting in week 4. Simply submit two tasks those weeks and I will drop the lower grades from your other tasks.\n\n\nThere are two tasks this week (Invitation, Setting Up). Both are to be submitted on Brightspace.\n\n\nFind two data visualizations that you find informative, compelling, or in need of improvement.\nCreate a document that shows each visualization (the figure, or a snapshot of a dynamic visualization), provides the source (e.g., url and publication details if applicable). In a short paragraph describe\n\nthe data behind the visualization,\nmain message conveyed by the visualization,\none or two features of the visualization that make it effective or provide suggestions for improvement.\n\nThe goal of this task isn’t to be right or wrong in your assessment, but rather to develop a practice of looking at data visualizations through the perspective of creator, designer, and critic. It’s okay if you find visualizations from secondary sources and not the creator or original publisher. Include the reference to the source you used to find the visualizations.\nSubmit your work as a single PDF on Brightspace.\n\n\n\n(Not to be handed in for marks.)\nRead Healy, Sections 2.1-2.4, which contains excellent advice on the reasons for using R markdown, R/Rstudio, projects, the basics of R, and being patient as you learn computing tasks.\nMake a list of about 10 key takeaway messages from the reading. For example, I would start with\n\nDo all my learning and work in R in R markdown documents created with Rstudio. This is a new skill to learn, but will be worthwhile. Don’t use a word processor. Don’t cut and paste code and results from the R console into a document. It’s too easy to make mistakes this way and will take longer.\nTake notes about what I learn (for ggplot and other skills). I’ll write these in a private Rmd document called data-viz-notes.Rmd (or something like that)\n\n\n\n\nSee the instructions in the syllabus or in Lesson 3 notes.\n\nInstall R, Rstudio, and the packages listed in Lesson 3.\nInstall git.\nCreate a github account.\nLogin to rstudio.cloud. This is a complete R, Rstudio, and git setup “in the cloud” that can be used if you have trouble using R on your own computer. I suggest you login using your git account to link Rstudio to git.\nAsk for help with any of these tasks if you need it.\n\nAnswer the quiz on Brightspace which will ask if you were successful with each task or if you need help. Provide your github name in one of the quiz questions.\n\n\n\n\nTask 3 should be submitted on Brightspace this week.\n\n\nYour task for this lesson is to answer two specific questions about choices made when visualizing data, drawing on your own experience and the ideas presented below. You should also become familiar with Healy, Chapter 1 which contains much more on these topics.\n\nSome people feel very strongly about the placement of 0 on the vertical scale of plots. Look again at the carbon dioxide plots in Lesson 1. The vertical scale does not start at 0. Use the ideas in Healy, Chapter 1.6 to describe how you would interpret vertical position on the carbon dioxide plots and how you could interpret this position if 0 was included on the vertical scale.\nHans Rosling’s visualizations (as shown in Lesson 1) use many channels for conveying data: x and y position, color, size, an annotation for year in the plot background. The interactive versions use an animation for change over time, and mouse-over pop-ups to identify the country for each dot. These are very complex visualizations!\n\nFor Rosling’s plot show in in Lesson 1, what variables are shown for each of x and y position, color, and symbol size?\nAccording to Healy, Chapter 1 which of these 4 features is most difficult to make quantitative comparisons with? Why? Do you agree?\nIn your judgment, is this visualization effective or too complex? Watch the TED talk or experiment with the interactive version before answering the question. Does the live explanation provided in Rosling’s oral presentation help you interpret the plot?\n\n\nWrite answers for these two questions in a word processor (we’ll start using R markdown soon) and submit as a single PDF on Brightspace.\n\n\n\nRepeat the examples from Lesson 5 until you are comfortable with the basics of making a plot. We will learn much more about plotting starting the lesson after next. Refer to Healy, Section 2.6 for a different basic plot.\nThere is nothing to submit for this task.\n\n\n\n\nNo assigned tasks this week. Work on Assignment 1 instead.\n\n\nYour task for this lesson is to review some material on ggplot to connect the ideas from the previous lesson to the concept of the grammar of graphics to prepare you for starting to learn the details in the next lesson. There are a few multiple choice questions to answer in this week’s task repository.\nIn addition, I suggest the following reading with nothing to submit:\n\nBrowse the R graph gallery to explore the huge variety of visualiaations you can make with R. Practice thinking about how the language of aesthetic mappings, geometries, and scales can be used to describe these visualizations.\nRead through the ggplot cheatsheet to see how the concepts of the grammar of graphics will be connected to computer code. Don’t worry about the details – you will practice making visualizations using these tools over many future lessons.\n\n\n\n\nPractice using ggplot to make graphs by reproducing examples from mini-lecture or notes, and modifying them by changing variables used in aesthetic mappings. If you would like, use other data sources described in “Data Sources” chapter in course notes.\nThere is nothing to submit for this task.\n\n\n\n\nThe tasks for this week and the rest of the course are to be submitted using GitHub.\n\n\nExercises to practice filter, group_by, summarize, and mutate. File task-summarize.Rmd.\nEdit the file task-summarize.Rmd following the instructions in the file. When you are done, knit the file to be sure there are no errors. Commit the .Rmd file to your repository and push the changes to GitHub. There is no need to commit the html file; I will knit your file on my computer to be sure there are no errors.\n\n\n\nExercises to practice making faceted plots. When you are done, knit the file and commit the tasks-facets.Rmd file to your repository. Push the changes to github to submit your work.\n\n\n\nI will get you to practice reading files later on in the course. For now,\n\npay attention to the code I use in future lessons for reading files, and\ndownload the Excel file from the lesson, practice reading it into R, editing it in Excel (or another spreadsheet), and confirming that you can read the changes with R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReshaping data practice. File: task-reshape.Rmd.\n\n\n\nDisplaying tables practice. File: task-tables.Rmd\n\n\n\nThe material in this lesson should be helpful if you run into challenges while working on Assignment 2, which asks you to develop new skills with unfamiliar functions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice adding linear models and smooths to visualizations. Reproduce some of the examples from the course notes, mini-lecture, or course textbook. Create new visualizations of your own design by changing the model, data, or underlying visualization. Experiment with colors and facets.\n\n\n\nExercises on linear models. File: task-linear-models.Rmd.\n\n\n\nExercises on LOESS and GAM smooths. File: task-LOESS-GAM.Rmd.\n\n\n\nIf you would like to work in a team with specific classmates, edit the file team-planning.Rmd in the Task repository. Write the GitHub user ID of the one or two students you would like to work with to the file. If you want to be assigned a random team mate, you don’t need to do anything.\nTo have your preferences recorded, commit the .Rmd file to the repository and push the repository to github by October 16, 2022. Otherwise I will assign you to a team at random.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice skills associated with collaborating on GitHub. File task-collaboration.Rmd.\n\n\n\nLook for some data on the internet. Download the data to your computer. Read the data into R. Make a summary table describing some part of the data. Make a visualization using some of the data. Can you find any formatting errors in the data? Did you have any trouble reading the data into R?\nYou can use any data you like for this task. If you want a specific suggestion, get some data from gapminder.org or another source in the lesson.\n\n\n\nWe’ve been using R markdown to make reproducible reports throughout the course. In this task, practice using here and chunk options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a PCA and MDS plot as described in the file task-PCA.Rmd.\n\n\n\nCreate a K-means analysis and accompanying visualization as described in the file task-kmeans.Rmd. This task is in the repository for task 12, 13, and 14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate and modify a Quarto presentation as described in the lesson. Ensure you know how to\n\nshow graphics output, but not the code that generated it,\nmake the graphic the right size to fit on the slide,\nopen the HTML version in your web browser.\n\nFile: task-presentation.qmd.\n\n\n\n\nThis is the fall break. No tasks this week.\n\n\n\n\n\nPractice making a map from the lesson\n\n\n\nMake maps described in the file task-maps.Rmd.\n\n\n\nShow geographic data without maps as described in task-map-alternatives.Rmd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercises with strings, factors, dates, and times. See task-factors-dates.Rmd.\n\n\n\nMake a custom color scale using a web interactive tool and then use those colours on a plot. Select a palette from a list given in the lesson and use it in a visualization.\n\n\n\nLearn to use theme elements as described in the repository. See task-themes.Rmd.\nThat is the last task for the course!\n\n\n\n\n\nAssignments are opportunities to apply and combine the skills from several lessons. They are both structured, in that you are asked to use specific skills to accomplish a task, and creative in that you have some flexibility in the product you produce. You will be assessed on your use of technical skills and your judgement in making well-designed and effective visualizations, following the principles explored in the course.\n\n\nYour assignment is to get the repositories for Assignments and Tasks on to your computer.\n\nGo to your github account and look for a repository called data-viz-assignments- followed by your github user name. Get the link by clicking the green button labeled “Code”. It should look like this: https://github.com/Dalhousie-AndrewIrwin-Teaching/data-viz-assignments-<your github name>.git\nUsing Rstudio on your computer, select menu File > New Project > From repository… > Git. Insert the link to the repository and tell R where to put the repository on your computer.\nIf you use rstudio.cloud, start at the projects page and choose New Project from git repository (pop-up menu) or open your existing project for our course. Clone the github repository in your project using the terminal window and type the command git clone <link from github>. Finally, open the new folder in the Files pane and click on the “assignments.Rproj” link to switch to the project. You may be asked by rstudio.cloud to link to your github account to access private repositories.\n\nRepeat these steps, changing assignments to tasks to get the repository with your Tasks.\nOpen the Assignments project and edit assignment-1.Rmd. Follow the instructions in that file. If you have trouble with this assignment, ask for help. It’s very important.\nUse the assignment repository for this work and all assignments in the course.\nIf, when you try to push your work back to github, you get an error “Author identity unknown”, you need to type the following two commands into the R Terminal window:\ngit config --global user.email \"you@example.com\"\ngit config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\nReplace you@example.com and Your Name with your email address and your name. Keep the quotation marks.\n\n\n\nThere are so many packages and functions to make visualizations, that its really important to be able to read documentation and learn new functions. Fortunately, the design of ggplot means that many functions work very similarly and so once you have learned the basics, it’s quite easy to learn more on your own.\nThe purpose of this assignment is for you to practice this sort of learning. I’ve picked out a few functions that work much like the examples we’ve looked at already. Your assignment is to pick out two of these and make a R markdown document describing how they work. This is the sort of practice I do all the time when I learn a new R skill.\nLook in the file assignment-2.Rmd for a template for this assignment.\n\n\n\nPractice using methods developed in the course so far (summarizing, ggplot visualizations, linear regression, smooths) to explore a data set and answer questions about the data.\n\n\n\nTidy Tuesday is a weekly activity to support people learning to use R for data analysis and visualization. Each week a new dataset is posted and interested participants post their visualizations. Some are complex pieces of work by people with lots of experience, but many are the work of beginners just learning to make good visualizations. I encourage you to explore the datasets and example visualizations others have made as a source of ideas and inspiration.\nFor the next two assignments, I’ll select a few datasets and ask you to work with one of those for your assignment.\nFor this assignment you will make scatter plots with smooths (linear, loess, or gam) and dimensionality reduction (PCA or MDS). The goal is to gain some insight into the data and present some aspect of the data in a visually appealing way. You may be able to use the data as its presented, or you may need to transform it in some way first (for example using the dplyr tools). You should feel free to show a subset of the data if you think that makes a better visualization to highlight a particular feature of the data.\nPresent your work as a short R markdown report. You should describe the dataset, explain any analysis or transformations you did, present at least 2 visualizations, and describe the main messages conveyed by your visualization. Full instructions are in the repostory.\n\n\n\nThis is the second Tidy Tuesday assignment. Create maps as described in the repository.\nOrganize your work as a slide presentation. A template with instructions is in the repository.\n\n\n\nThis is a peer evaluation assignment. You should provide, in separate documents as described in the repository,\n\nconfidential feedback on your team mates’ work for the term project\na peer evaluation of two oral presentations from other teams.\n\nYou should provide thoughtful and constructive feedback on the work of your classmates. Everyone’s work has good aspects and areas where there could be improvement; you should aim to provide useful feedback in both areas.\nYour assignment for the peer evaluation is in the Teams tab of this website.\nA rubric and guide for your evaluations is in the repository for this assignment.\n\n\n\n\nYour final project is an analysis on a dataset of your own choosing. You can choose the data based on your interests, based on work in other courses, or independent research projects. You should demonstrate many of the techniques from the course, applying them as appropriate to develop and communicate insight into the data.\nYou should create compelling visualizations of your data. Pay attention to your presentation: neatness, coherency, and clarity will count. All analyses must be done in RStudio using R.\n\n\nWork in groups of 2 or 3 according to the assignments made in late October. You can produce team products, or one product per team member, whichever you prefer. You have two roles in the project. First you will contribute your original creative work for the project. Second, you will act as a collaborator, providing your teammates with feedback, suggestions, debugging help, proofreading and other assistance as requested.\nUse a single GitHub repository for the proposal, presentation, and final report. Use the repository I created for your team. See the notes on collaboration with GitHub for guidance. Contact me if you have trouble.\n\n\n\nTeams will be created in October. If you would like to form a team with someone else in the class, edit the team-planning.Rmd document in the Tasks repository to add your request. If you would like to be assigned a randomly selected team mate, there will be a way to indicate that too. The deadline for selecting teammates will be Sunday 16 October. I will review this list, finalize the team assignments, create the presentation schedule and peer-evaluation assignments later that week.\nIf you withdraw from the course once you have been assigned to a team for the term project, please let your teammates and me know as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nYour main task for the proposal is to find a data set to analyze for your project and describe at least one question you can address with data visualizations.\nIt is important that you choose a readily accessible data set that is large enough so multiple relationships can be explored, but no so complex that you get lost. I suggest your data set should have at least 50 observations and about 10 variables. If you find a bigger data set, you can make a subset to work with for your project. The data set should include categorical and quantitative variables. If you plan to use a data set that comes in a format that we haven’t encountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into R as this can be tricky depending on the source. If you are having trouble ask for help before it is too late.\nDo not reuse data sets from any part of the course.\nHere is list of data repositories containing many interesting data sets. Feel free to use data from other sources if you prefer.\n\nTidyTuesday\nKaggle\nOpenIntro\nAwesome public datasets\nBikeshare data portal\nHarvard Dataverse\nStatistics Canada\nOpen government data: Canada, NS, and many other sources\nOther sources listed in the Data sources section of the course notes\nData you find on your own may be suitable too.\n\nDescribe a data set and question you can address with the data for your proposal. Outline a plan to use five visualizations (e.g., data overview plot, dplyr/table summary, small multiples, smoothing/regression, k-means/PCA, map).\nThe repository contains a template for your proposal called proposal.Rmd. Write your proposal by revising this file and using this template.\n\nQuestions: The introduction should introduce your research questions\nData: Describe the data (where it came from, how it was collected, what are the cases, what are the variables, etc.). Place your data in the /data folder. Show that you can read the data and include the output of dplyr::glimpse() or skimr::skim() on your data in the proposal.\nVisualization plan:\n\nThe outcome (response, Y) and predictor (explanatory, X) variables you will use to answer your question.\nIdeas for at least two possible visualizations for exploratory data analysis, including some summary statistics and visualizations, along with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data.\nAn idea of how at least one statistical method described in the course (smoothing, PCA, k-means) could be useful in analyzing your data\n\nTeam planning: briefly describe how members of your team will divide the tasks to be performed.\n\nAssessment. See the file grade-proposal.rmd for the assessment guidelines and rubric.\n\n\n\nThe oral presentation should be about 5 minutes long. The goal is to present the highlights of your project and allow for feedback which can be incorporated as you revise your written report.\nYou should have a small number of slides to accompany your presentation. I have provided a template for you to use as presentation.qmd. I suggest a format such as the following:\n\nA title with team members’ names\nA description of the data you are analyzing\nAt least one question you can investigate with your data visualization\nAt least two data visualizations\nA conclusion\n\nFor suggestions on making slide presentations see the lesson on slides.\nDon’t show your R code; the focus should be on your results and visualizations not your computing. Set echo = FALSE to hide R code (this is already done in the template).\nYour presentation should not just be an account of everything you tried (“then we did this, then we did this, etc.”), instead it should convey what choices you made, and why, and what you found.\nPresentation schedule: Presentations will take place during the last two synchronous sessions of the course. You can choose to do your presentation live or pre-record it. You will watch presentations from other teams and provide feedback on one each day in the form of peer evaluations. The presentation schedule will be generated randomly.\nAssessment. See the file grade-presentation.Rmd for the assessment guidelines.\nPractice your presentation, as a team, using the course collaborate room or other videoconferencing tool!\n\n\n\nFollow the template provided for your written report (report.Rmd) to present your visualizations and insights about your data. Review the marking guidelines in grade-report.rmd and ask questions if any of the expectations are unclear.\nStyle and format does count for this assignment, so please take the time to make sure everything looks good and your tables and visualizations are properly formatted.\nYou and your teammate will be using the same repository, so merge conflicts will happen, issues will arise, and that’s fine! Pull work from github before you start, commit your changes, and push often. Ask questions when stuck. Look at the lesson on collaboration for help.\nIn your knitted report your R code should be hidden (echo = FALSE) so that your document is neat and easy to read. However your document should include all your code such that if I re-knit your R Markdown file I will obtain the results you presented. If you want to highlight something specific about a piece of code, you’re welcome to show that portion.\nGeneral criteria for evaluation:\n\nContent - What is the quality of research question and relevancy of data to those questions?\nCorrectness - Are visualization procedures carried out and explained correctly?\nWriting and Presentation - What is the quality of the visualizations, writing, and explanations?\nCreativity and Critical Thought - Is the project carefully thought out? Does it appear that time and effort went into the planning and implementation of the project?"
