```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(usethis)
library(gitcreds)
```

A demonstration of using version control software with Rstudio.

* Test git is working by typing `git` in the Terminal window
* Introduce yourself to git if you haven't done this before by typing these lines in the Terminal window
    -   `git config --global user.email "you\@example.com"`
    -   `git config --global user.name "Your Name"`
* Go to github web page: [github.com](https://github.com/)
* Find your assignment repository
* Create a new project on your computer using Rstudio and this repository
* At some point in this process you need to get Rstudio and GitHub to communicate with each other. You need to create a GitHub personal access token (PAT) and tell R about it.
    - In the R console, type `usethis::create_github_token()`. This will open up a web browser. You will be asked to login and perhaps use two factor authentication. Eventually you will get a page that looks like the figure below. Enter a note to describe the token and pick an expiry date (my suggestions are shown in the screenshot.) Make sure you have at least the boxes shown below checked (repo, user, workflow). Click the green generate token at the bottom of the screen.
    - Copy the random numbers and letters that make up your token by clicking the two overlapping blue boxes (or highlight and select copy from the menu).
    - In the R console, type `gitcreds::gitcreds_set()` and then enter the PAT by pasting it into the console.
* Edit a file
* Stage and commit the changes
* Push the changes to github
* See that the changes have appeared on the github website
