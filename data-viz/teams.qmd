The term project is to be completed in teams.

If you know who you want to form a team with (2 or 3 people per team), enter this information in the task repository, file team-planning.Rmd before October 18. You will need to wait until the second week of term to learn how to do this!

By October 24, this document will list

* who is on each team,
* the schedule of presentations for each team,
* the schedule of peer evaluations for each student.
